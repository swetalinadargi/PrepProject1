 <h1>Backtracking</h1> 
 <p>Backtracking is a form of recursion</p>
 <p>The ususal scenario is that you are feced with a number of options, and you must chose one of these. after you make you<br>
     choice you will get a new set of options; just what set of options you get depends on what choice you made. this procedure is<br> 
    repetaed over and over until you reach a final state. if you made a good sequence of choices, your final state is a goal state; if<br> 
    you didn't, it isn't.
 </p>
 <p>Conceptually, you start at the root of a tree; the tree probably has some good leaves and some bad leaves, though it may be that<br>
    the leaves are all good or all bad. you want to get to a good leaf. At each node, beginining with the root, you choose one of its <br>
    children to move to, and you keep this until you get to a leaf.
 </p>
 <p>Suppose you get to a bad leaf. You can backtrack to continue the search for a good leaf by revoking your most recent choice,
    and<br> trying out the next option in that set of options. If you run out of opptions, revoke the choice that got you here, and try
    another<br> choice at that node. If you end up at the root with no options left, there are no good leaves to be found.
 </p>
 <p>This needs an example.</p>
 <img src="./p11.png" width="444px" height="233px">
 <ol type="1">
   <li>Starting at Root, your options are A and B. You choose A.</li>&nbsp;
   <li>At A, your options are C and D. You choose C.</li>&nbsp;
   <li>C is bad. Go back to A.</li>&nbsp;
   <li>At A, you have already tried C, and it failed. Try D.</li>&nbsp;
   <li>D is bad. Go back to A.</li>&nbsp;
   <li>At A, you have no options left to try. Go back to Root</li>&nbsp;
   <li>At Root, you have already tried A. Try B.</li>&nbsp;
   <li>At B, your options are E and F. Try E.</li>&nbsp;
   <li>E is a good. Congratulations!</li>&nbsp;
</ol>
<p>In this example we draw a picture ofa  tree.The trees is an abstract mode of thr possible sequence of choices we could <br>
make. There is also a data structure called a tree, but usually we don't have a data structuer to tell us what choieces we <br>
have. (If we do have an actual tree data structure, backtracking on it is called depth-first tree searching.)  </p>
<hr>
<h3>The backtracking algorithem.</h3>
<div style="border: 1px;">
<pre style=" color: blue; border-radius: 5px; border: 2px solid gray;">boolean solve(Node n) {
   if n is a leaf node {
       if the leaf is a goal node, return true
       else return false
   } else {
       for each child c of n {
           if solve(c) succeeds, return true
       }
       return false
   }
}</pre>
</div>
<p>Notice that the algorithem is expressed as a boolean function. This is essential to understanding the algorithem. If <br>
solve(n) is true, that means node n is part of solution--that is , node n is one of path from the root to<br>
 some goal node. We say that n is solvable. If solve(n) is false, then there is no path that includes n to any goal node.</p>
 <h3>How does this work?</h3>
 <ul type="disc">
   <li>If any child node of n is solvable, then n is solvable.</li>
   <li>If no child of n is solvable, then n is not solvable.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Hence, to decide whether any non-leaf node n is solvable (part of a path a goal node), all you have to do is test whether any<br>
child of n is solvable. This is done recursively, on each child of n. In the above code, this is done by the lines <pre style="color: blue; border-radius: 5px; border: 2px solid gray;">
for each child c of n {
   if solve(c) succeeds, return true
}
return false</pre> Eventually the recursion will "bottom" out at a leaf node. If the leaf node is a goal node, it is solvable; if the leaf node is not a goal<br>
node, it is not solvable. This is our base case. In the above code, this is done by the lines<pre style="color: blue; border-radius: 5px; border: 2px solid gray;">
if n is a leaf node {
if the leaf is a goal node, return true 
else return false}</pre>The backtracking algorithem is simple but important. You should understand it thoroughly. Another way os stating it is as follows:<br>
</p>
<ul type="disc">
   <li><p><b>To search a tree:</b></p></li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
   <li>If the tree consists of a single leaf, test whether it is a goal node.</li>
   <li>Otherwise, search the substress until you find one containing a goal node, or until you have<br>
   searched them all unsuccessfully.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Non-recursive bactracking, using a stack</h3>
<p>Back tracking is a rather typical recursive algorithem, and any recursive algorithem can be rewritten as a stack algorithem. in fact,<br>
that is how youe recursive algorithems are translated into machine or assembly language.<pre style="color: blue; border-radius: 5px; border: 2px solid gray;">
boolean solve(Node n) {
   put node n on the stack;
   while the stack is not empty{
      if the node at the top of the stack is a leaf {
         if it is a goal node, return true
         else pop it off the stack
      }
      else {
         if the node at the top of the stack has untried children 
         push the next untried child onto the stackelse pop the node off the stack
      }
      return false
   }
   </pre>
Starting from the root, the only nodes that can be pushed onto the stack are the children of the node currently on the top of the<br>
stack, and these are only pushed on one child at time; hence, the nodes on the stack at all times describe a valid path in the <br>
tree. Nodes are removed from the stack only when it is knoen that they have no goal nodes among their descendents. Therefore,<br>
if the root node gets removed (making the stack empty), there must have been no goal nodes at all, and no solution to the<br>
problem.  
</p>
<p>When the stack algorithem terminates successfully, the nodes on the stack from (in reverse order) a path from the root to a goal<br>
node.</p>
<p>Similarly, when the recursive algorithem finds a goal node, the path information is emboided (in reverse order) in the sequence of<br>
recursive calls. Thus as the recursion unwinds, the path can be recovered one node at a time, by(for instace) printing the node<br>
at the current level, or sorting it in an array. </p>
<p>Here is the recursive backtracking algorithem, modified slightly to print (in reverse order) the nodes along the successful path:<pre style="color: blue; border-radius: 5px; border: 2px solid gray;">
boolean solve(Node n) {
   if n is a laf node {
      if the leaf is a goal node {
         print n 
         return true
      }
      else return false
   }
   else {
      for each child c of n {
         if solve(c) succeeds {
            print n 
            return true
         }
      }
      return false
   }
}
</pre></p>
<h3>Keeping backtracking simple</h3>
<p>All of these versions of the backtracking algorithem are pretty simple, but when applies to a real problem, they can get pretty<br>
cluttered up with details. Even determining whether the node is a leaf can be complex.<br></p>
<p>for example, if the pah represent a series of moves in a chess endgame problem, the leaves are the checkmate and stalemate <br>
solutions.</p>
<p>To keep the program clean, therfore, tests like this should be buried in methods. In a chess game , for example, you could test<br>
whether a node is a leaf by writing a g<b>gameOver method</b> (or you could even call it <b>isLeaf</b>). This method would encapsulate al;l the <br>
ugly details of figuring out whether any possible moves remain.</p>
<p>Notice that the backtracking algorithem require us to keep track, for each node on the current path, which of its children have<br>
been tried already (so we don't have to try them again). In the above code we made this look simple, by just saying <b>for each child<br>
c of n.</b> In reality, it may be deficult to figure out what the possible children are, and there may be no obvious way to step through<br>
them. In chess, foe example, a node can represent one arrangement of pieces on a chessboard, and each child that node can <br>
represent the arrangement after some piece has made a legal move. How do you find these children, and how do you keep track<br>
of which ones you've already examined</p>
<p>The most straightforword way to keep track of which children of the node have been tried is as follows: Upon initial entry to the<br>
node (that is, when you first get there from above), make a list of all its childre. As you try each child, take it off the list. When<br>
the list is empty, there are no remaining untried children, and you can return "failure". This is a simple approch, but it may require<br>
quite a lot of additional work.</p>
<p>There is an easier way to keep track of which children have been tried, if you can define an ordering on the children if there is an <br>
ordering, and you know which child you just trie, youcan determine which child to try next.</p>
<p>For example, youmight be able to number the <b>children 1 through n</b>, and try them in numerical order. Then, if you havejust tried<br>
<b>child k</b>, you know that you have already tried children 1 through <b>k-1</b>, and you have not yet tried children<b>k+1</b> through<b>n</b>. Or, if yet<br>
are trying to color a map with just four colors, yet can always try <b> red first,then yellow,then green,then blue</b>. If child yellow falls,<br>
yellow can try child green next. If yopu are searching a maze, you can try choieces in the order left,straight,right<b>(or perhaps<br>
   north,east,south,west)</b>.</p>
   <p>
    it isn't always easy to find a simple way to order the children of a node.<b> In the chss game eaxample</b>, you might number your <br>
    pieces (or perhaps the squares of the board) and try them in numerical ofder , but in additional each piece may also have sevaral<br>
    moves, and these must also be ordered.    
   </p>
   <p><b>Example: Tree Search</b></p>
   <p>For startes, let's do the simplest possible example of backtracking , which is searching an actual tree.We also use the<br>
   simplest kind of tree, a binary tree</p>
   <p>
A binary tree is a data structure composed of nodes. One node is designated as the root node can reference (point<br>
to) zero, one, ot teo other nodes, which are called it's children. The children are refered to as the left child and the right child<br>
All nodes are reachable(by one or more steps) from the root node , and there are no cycles. For our purpose, although this is not <br> 
part of the definition of a binary tree, we will say thst a node might or might not be a goal node, and will contain it's name . The<br>
first example in this paper (which we reapeat here) shows a binary tree.
   </p>
   <p>Here a definition of the Binary Tree class:
      <pre style="color: blue; border-radius: 5px; border: 2px solid gray;">Public class Binary Tree {
         Binary Tree leftChild=null;
         Binary Tree rightChild=null;
         boolean isGoalNode=false;
         String name;<br>
         Binary Tree(String name, BinaryTree left,BinaryTree right,boolean isGoalNode){
            this.name=name;
            leftChild=left;
            rightChild=right;
            this.isGoalNode=isGoalNode;
         }
      }
      </pre>
      Next we will create a TreeSearch class, and in it we will define a mwthod makeTree() which constructs the above binary tree.<br>
      <pre style="color: blue; border-radius: 5px; border: 2px solid gray;">
         Static BinartTree makeTree() {
            BinaryTree root, a, b, c, d, e, f;
            c=new BinartTree("C",null, null, false);
            d=new BinartTree("D",null, null, false);
            e=new BinartTree("E",null, null, false);
            f=new BinartTree("F",null, null, false);
            a=new BinartTree("A",c,d, false);
            b=new BinartTree("B",e,f, false);
            root=new BinartTree("Root",a,b,false);
            return root;
         }
      </pre>
      Here's main program to create a binary tree and try to solve it:
      <pre style="color: blue; border-radius: 5px; border: 2px solid gray;">
      public static void main(String args[]) {
         BinaryTree tree = makeTree();
         System.out.println(solvable(tree));
      }
      </pre>
      And finally, here's the recursive backtracking routine to "solve" the binary tree by finding a goal node.
      <pre style="color: blue; border-radius: 5px; border: 2px solid gray;">
      static boolean solvable(BinartTree node) {
         /*1*/ if (node == null) return false;
         /*2*/ if (node.isGoalNode) return true;
         /*3*/ if(solvable(node.leftChild)) return true;
         /*4*/ if (solvable (node.rightChild )) return false;
         /*5*/ return false;
      }
      </pre>
      Here's what the numbered lines are doing:
      <ol type="1">
         <li>If we are given a null node, it's not solvable. This statement is so that we call this metod with the children of a node, without<br>
         first checkinh whether those children actually exist. </li>
         <li>
            If the node we are given is a goal node, return success.
         </li>
         <li>
            See if the lect childe node is solvable, and if so, conclude that node is solvable. We will only get to this line if node is non-null<br>
            and is not a goal node, says to.
         </li>
         <li>
            Do the same thing for the right child.
         </li>
         <li>
            Since niether child of node is solvable,node itself is not solvable.
         </li>
      </ol>
      This program runs correclty and produce the unelightening result true.
   </p>
   <p>
      Each time we ask for another node, we have to check if it is null. In the above we put that check as the first thing in solvable. An<br>
      alternate would be to check first whether each child exists, and recur only if they do. Here's that alternative version.
      <pre style="color: blue; border-radius: 5px; border: 2px solid gray;">
      static boolean solvable(BinartTree node) {
         if (node.isGoalNode) return true;
         if (node.leftChild != null && solvable(node.leftChild)) return true;
         if (node.rightChild != null && solvable(node.rightChild)) return true;
         return false;
      }
      </pre>
      I think the first version is simpler, but the second version is slightly more efficient.
   </p>
   <hr>
   <h3>What are the children?</h3>
   <p>
      one of the things that simplifies the above binary tree search is that, at each choice point, you can ignore all the previous<br>
      choices. previous choices don't give any information about what you should do next, as far as you known , both the left and the <br>
      right child are possible solutions. In many problems, however, you may be able to eliminate children immediately, without<br>
      recursion.
   </p>
   <p>
      Consider, for example, the problem of four-colouring a map. It is a theroem of mathematics that any map on a plane, no matter<br>
      how convolutd the countries are, can be colored wih at most four colors, so that no teo countries that share a border are the <br>
      same color.
   </p>
   <p>
      To color a map, you choose a color for the first country, then a color for the second country, and so on, until all the countries are <br>
      colored.
   </p>
   <p>There are two ways to do this:</p>
   <ul type="disc">
      <li>
         Method 1. Try each of the four possible colors, and recur. When you run out of countries, check whether you are at a goal node. 
      </li>
      <li>
         Method 2. Try only those colors that have not already been used for an adjecent country, and recur. If and when you run out of <br>
         countries, you have successfully colored the map. 
      </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
      Let's apply each of these two methods to the problem of coloring a checkboard. This should be easily solvable, after all a <br>
      Checkboard anly needs two colors.
   </p>
   <h3>boolean maplsOK()</h3>
   Used by method 1 to check (at a leaf node) whether the entire map is colored correclty</p>
   <p><b>boolean okToColor(int row,int column,int color)</b><br>
   Used by method 2 to check , at a every node, whether the entire is an adjecent node already colored with the given color.</p>
   <p><b>int[] nextRowAndColumn(int row, int column)</b><br>
   Used by both methods to find the next 'country'(actually, the row and column of the next square on the checkboard )</p>
   <p>Here's the code for method 1.
      <pre style="color: blue; border-radius: 5px; border: 2px solid gray;">
      boolean explore1(int row, int column, int color) {
         if (row >= NUM-ROWS) return maplsOK();
         map[row][column] = color;
         for (int nextColor = RED; nextColor <= BLUE; nextColor++) {
            int[] next = nextRowAndColumn(row,column);
            if (explore1(next[0],next[1],nextColor)) return true;
         }
         return false;
      }
      </pre>
      And here's the code for method 2:
      <pre style="color: blue; border-radius: 5px; border: 2px solid gray;">
         boolean explore2(int row,int column,int color) {
            if(row >= NUM-ROWS)return true;
            if (okToColor(row,column,color)) {
               map[row][column] = color;
               for (int nextColor = RED; nextColor <= BLUE; nextColor++) {
                  int[] next = nextRowAndColumn(row,column);
                  if (explore2(next[0], next[1], nextColor)) return true;
               }
            }
            return false;
         }
         </pre>
         Those appear pretty similar, and you might think they are qually good. However, the timing information suggests otherwise:<br><br>
         <br>

<center>
<table border="2px">
   <TR>
      <td></td>
      <td bgcolor="#858585">2 by 3 map</td>
      <td bgcolor="#858585">3 by 3 map</td>
      <td bgcolor="#858585">3 by 4 map</td>
   </TR>
   <tr>
      <td bgcolor="#858585">Method 1:</td>
      <td>60 ms.</td>
      <td>940 ms.</td>
      <td>60530 ms.(1 minute)</td>
   </tr>
      <tr>
         <td bgcolor="#858585">Method 2:</td>
         <td>0 ms.</td>
         <td>0 ms.</td>
         <td>0 ms.</td>
      </tr>
   
</table>
</center><br><br><br>
The zeros in the above table indicate times too short to measure (less than 1 millisecond). Why this huge difference? Either of<br>
 these methods could have exponential growth. Eliminating a node automatically eliminates all of its descendents, and this will <br>
 often prevent exponential growth. Conversely, by waiting to check until a leaf node is reached, exponential growth is practically <br>
 guaranteed. If there is any way to eliminate children (reduce the set of choices), do so!
   </p>
   <hr>
   <h3>Debugging techniques</h3>
   <p>Often our first try at a program doesn't work, and we need to debug it. Debuggers are helpful, but sometimes we need to fall <br>
      back on inserting print statements. There are some simple tricks to making effective use of print statements. These tricks can be<br>
       applied to any program, but are especially useful when you are trying to debug recursive routines.
   </p>
   <h4>Trick #1: Indent when you print method entries and exits.</h4>
   <p>Often, the best debugging technique is to print every method call and return (or at least the most important ones). You probably<br>
       want to print, for each method, what parameters it came in with, and what value it leaves with. However, if you just print a long <br>
       list of these, it's hard to match up method exits with their corresponding entries. Indenting to show the level of nesting can help.
   </p>
   <h4>Trick #2: Use specialized print methods for debugging.</h4>
   <p>Don't clutter up your actual code more than you must. Also, remember that code inserted for debugging purposes can itself<br>
       contain bugs, or (in the worst case) can affect the results, so be very careful with it.</p>
<p>Here's our debugging code. For this trivial program, there's almost more debugging code than actual code, but in larger programs<br>
    the proportions will be better.
    <pre style="color: blue; border-radius: 5px; border:2px solid gray ;">
      static string indent ="";


      static String name(BinaryTree node) {
          if (node == null) return null;
          else return node.name;
      }
      static void enter(BinaryTree node) {
          System.out.println(indent + "Entering solvable(" + name(node) + ")");
          indent = indent + "|  ";
      }
      static boolean yes(BinaryTree node) {
          indent = indent.substring(3);
          System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") returns true");
          return true;
      }
      static boolean no(BinaryTree node) {
          indent = indent.substring(3);
          System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") returns false");
          return false;
      }
  
  
   </pre>
To use this code, we modify solvable as follows:
<pre style="color: blue; border-radius: 5px; border:2px solid gray ;">
   static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node) {
      enter(node);
      if (node == null) return no(node);
      if (node.isGoalNode) return yes(node);
      if (solvable(node.leftChild)) return yes(node);
      if (solvable(node.rightChild)) return yes(node);
      return no(node);
  }

 </pre>  
 <pre>  
 And we get these results:
Entering solvable(Root)
| Entering solvable(A) 
| | Entering solvable(C) 
| | | Entering solvable(null) 
| | | solvable(null) returns false 
| | | Entering solvable(null) 
| | | solvable(null) returns false 
| | solvable(C) returns false 
| | Entering solvable(D) 
| | | Entering solvable(null) 
| | | solvable(null) returns false 
| | | Entering solvable(null) 
| | | solvable(null) returns false 
| | solvable(D) returns false 
| solvable(A) returns false 
| Entering solvable(B) 
| | Entering solvable(E) 
| | solvable(E) returns true 
| solvable(B) returns true 
solvable (Root) returns true 
true 
</pre>
</p>
<h4>Trick #3: Never discard your debugging statements.</h4>
<p>Writing debugging statements is programming, too. Often it's as much work to debug the debugging statements as it is to debug <br>
   the actual program. Once your program is working, why throw this code away?</p>
   <p>Obviously, you don't want to print out all this debugging information from a program you are ready to submit (or to turn over to<br>
       your manager). You could comment out your debugging calls, but that can be a lot of work. What's more, in the above example,<br>
        you would have to replace every return(yes(node)) with return(true), and every return(no(node)) with return(false). With all these<br>
         changes, you might introduce new bugs into your program.</p>
         <p> simple solution is to make your debugging statements conditional. For example,
<pre  style="color: blue; border-radius: 5px; border:2px solid gray ;">

   static final boolean debugging = false;


   static void enter(BinaryTree node) {
       if (debugging) {
           System.out.println(indent + "Entering solvable(" + name(node) + ")");
           indent = indent + "|  ";
       }
   }
   static boolean yes(BinaryTree node) {
       if (debugging) {
           indent = indent.substring(3);
           System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") returns true");
       }
       return true;
   }
   static boolean no(BinaryTree node) {
       if (debugging) {
           indent = indent.substring(3);
           System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") returns false");
       }
           return false;
   }
   </pre>
   In industry, actual programs often have multiple flags to control different aspects of debugging. Don't worry too much about<br>
    making your code larger; modern compilers will notice that since the variable dibugging is final, it can never be true, and the <br>
   controlled code will be siscaeded. </p>
   <h4>Trick #4: Create an Exception.</h4>
   <p>If an Exception is thrown, you can get information about just where it happened by sending it the message<br>
       printStackTrace(PrintStream). Since an Exception is an object like any other, you can create and throw your own Exceptions.<br>
        However, Java programmers don't always realize that you can create an Exception without throwing it. For example, the following<br>
         code
<pre style="color: blue; border-radius: 5px; border:2px solid gray ;">
   new Exception("Checkpoint Charlie").printStackTrace(System.out);
</pre>
will print out a message something like this, and the program will then continue normally. That is, the above code just acts like a<br>
 print statement.
<pre style="color: blue; border-radius: 5px; border:2px solid gray ;">
   java.lang.Exception: Checkpoint Charlie
   at TreeSearch.solvable(TreeSearch.java:53)

<h3>Exampe: Cindy's Puzzel</h3>
<p>I call the following puzzle "Cindy's puzzle" for historical reasons. You have some number n of black marbles and the same number<br>
    of white marbles, and you have a playing board which consists simply of a line of 2n+1 spaces to put the marbles in. Start with <br>
    the black marbles all at one end (say, the left), the white marbles all at the other end, and a free space in between.</p><br>
    <center>
      <table border="2px" bgcolor="#D8D8D8">
         <tr>
            <td><img src="./Blackball.png"></td>
            <td><img src="./Blackball.png"></td>
            <td width="45px"></td>
            <td><img src="./Whiteball.png"></td>
            <td><img src="./Whiteball.png"></td>
         </tr>
      </table>
   </center>

<p>The goal is to reverse the position of the marbles</p>
<center>
   <table border="2px" bgcolor="#D8D8D8">
      <tr>
         <td><img src="./Whiteball.png"></td>
         <td><img src="./Whiteball.png"></td>
         <td width="45px"></td>
         <td><img src="./Blackball.png"></td>
         <td><img src="./Blackball.png"></td>
      </tr>
   </table>
</center>

<p>The black marbles can only move to the right, and the white marbles can only move to the left (no backing up). At each move, a <br>
   marble can either:
   <ul type="disc">
      <li>Move one space ahead, if that space is clear, or</li>
      <li>Jump ahead over exactly one marble of the opposite color, if the space just beyond that marble is clear. </li>
   </ul>
   For example, you could make the following sequence of moves:
   </p>

<p>The backtracking method is named solvableand returns a boolean. In solvable we shall need to check whether we are at a leaf,<br>
    which in this case means a position from which no further moves are possible. This isn't so easy.</p>
<p> Now to the program. The main program will initialize the board, and call a recursive backtracking routine to attempt to solve the<br>
    puzzle. The backtracking routine will either succeed and print out a winning path, or it will fail, and the main program will have to<br>
     print out the bad news.</p>
   <p>
   The backtracking method is named solvableand returns a boolean. In solvable we shall need to check whether we are at a leaf,<br>
    which in this case means a position from which no further moves are possible. This isn't so easy.</p>
   <p>
   Each possible move will result in a new board position, and these new board positions are the children of the current board<br>
    position. Hence to find the children of a node (that is, of a board position), we need only find the possible moves from that node.<br>
     Remember that it is also highly desirable to find an ordering on these possible moves.</p>
   <p>
   Here it is time to stop and take thought. To make progress, we must analyze the game to some extent. Probably a number of<br>
    approaches would work, and what follows is based on the way I worked it out. If you were to program this puzzle, you might find<br>
     a different but equally valid approach.</p>
   <p>
   First, notice that if a marble has a move, that move is unique: if it can move ahead one square, then it cannot jump.<br>
    If it can jump, it cannot move ahead one square. This suggests that, to find the possible moves, we might assign numbers to the marbles, and<br>
     check each marble in turn. When we have looked at all the marbles, we have looked at all the possible moves. This would require <br>
     having a table to keep track of where each marble is, or else somehow "marking" each marble with its number and searching the<br>
      board each time to find the marble we want. Neither alternative is very attractive.</p>
   <p>
   Next, notice that for a given board position, each marble occupies a unique space. Hence, instead of talking about moving a <br>
   particular marble, we can talk about moving the marble in a particular space. If a move is possible from a given space, then that<br>
    must be the only move possible from that space, because if the marble in that space has a move, it is unique. There is a slight <br>
    complication because not every space contains a marble, but at least the spaces (unlike the marbles) stay in one place.</p>
   <p><strong>Now we have a simpler ordering of moves to use in our program. Just check, in order, the 2n+1 spaces of the board. For each<br>
       space, either zero or one moves is possible. With this understanding, we can write a boolean method canMove(int[] board, int<br>
        position) which determines whether a move is possible from a given position:
      </strong>
   <ul>
      <li>If the position is empty, no move is possible;</li>
      <li>If the position contains a black marble, the method checks for a move or jump to the right; </li>
      <li>If the position contains a white marble, the method checks for a move or jump to the left. </li>
   </ul>
   We write another method <b>int[] makeMove(int[] oldBoard, int position)</b> that will take a board and a position, make a move from<br>
    that position, and return as its value a new board. (We could write this somewhat more efficiently by changing the old board,<br>
     rather than creating a new one, but here we are more concerned with simplicity.) In technical jargon, makeMove is "applicative"<br>
      rather than "mutative."</p>
      <p>Along with<strong> canMove and makeMove, </strong>we are using methods<strong>puzzleSolved And printBoard</strong> with meanings that<br>
          should be obvious.
<pre  style="color: blue; border-radius: 5px; border:2px solid gray ;">
   boolean solvable(int[] board) {
      if (puzzleSolved(board)) {
          return true;
      }
      for (int position = 0; position < BOARD_SIZE; position++) {
          if (canMove(board, position)) {
              int[] newBoard = makeMove(board, position);
              if (solvable(newBoard)) {
                  printBoard(newBoard);
                  return true;
              }
          }
      }
      return false;
  }
</pre>
Along with canMove and makeMove, we are using methods puzzleSolved And printBoard with meanings that should be obvious.
 </p>
 <p>Here is some output from the program:
   <ol type="1" start="16" reversed>
<li><strong> WHITE WHITE ----- BLACK BLACK BLACK</strong></li>
<li><strong>WHITE WHITE WHITE BLACK ----- BLACK BLACK
        </strong> </li>
<li><strong> WHITE WHITE ----- BLACK WHITE BLACK BLACK</strong> </li>
<li><strong> WHITE ----- WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK BLACK</strong> </li>
<li><strong> WHITE BLACK WHITE ----- WHITE BLACK BLACK</strong> </li>
<li><strong> WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE ----- BLACK</strong> </li>
<li><strong> WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK -----</strong> </li>
<li><strong> WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK ----- BLACK WHITE</strong> </li>
<li><strong> WHITE BLACK ----- BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE</strong> </li>
<li><strong> ----- BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE</strong> </li>
<li><strong> BLACK ----- WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE</strong> </li>
<li><strong> BLACK BLACK WHITE ----- WHITE BLACK WHITE</strong> </li>
<li><strong> BLACK BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE ----- WHITE</strong> </li>
<li><strong>BLACK BLACK WHITE BLACK ----- WHITE WHITE</strong> </li>
<li><strong> BLACK BLACK ----- BLACK WHITE WHITE WHITE</strong> </li>
<li><strong>BLACK BLACK BLACK ----- WHITE WHITE WHITE</strong> </li>
</ol> 
Notice that the solution is given in reverse order: BLACK starts out on the left and WHITE on the right, as in the last<br>
 line. I've added line numbers to the actual output in order to emphasize this point. Backtracking always produces its<br>
  results (sequence of choices) in reverse order; it is up to you, the programmer, to reverse the results again to get<br>
   them in the correct order.
